~ Introduction / Scope ~ 

This is a program implemented in aproximately 8 hours, it consists in a singleton APP with a simple MySQL database interaction.
In this program I tried to include all the .NET as well as WPF interaction logic fundamental concepts.

First of all, I've developed a UserControl library in order to show one interesting approach related to the graphics hierarchy. 
with this approach I can implement totally customizable and real-time user controls avoiding the declaration of DataTemplates,
DataContext and ObservableCollections wich are 'glue code' wor the WPF architecture.

Then, I've separated all the 'Database operations' in another CSPROJ so in the end the main project is only in charge of merging graphics
interaction with filesystem stuff (in this case database).

I know the MainWindow intead of having a single parallel task I should have a Queue<task> and manage it with interlock.increment or a TaskScheduler,
but the time comes fast and I should deliver the job.


~ Instalation Pre-requisites ~

- Required OS: Windows

- Database Server
  To execute this software properly you should first install MySqlServer (Latest stable version preferably):
  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.7.html

- Database editor - MySQL Workbench (recommended)
  Once you have installed the server and setup your password you will need to add a new database called: 'usersateknea'

- SW executable - there is a .zip folder on the root folder containing the .exe it is called AtekneaApp.zip
  I couldn't have enough time to make the InnoSetup File.
  
  I hope you like this project and maybe I can continue updating this repository.
